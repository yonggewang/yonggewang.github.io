<h1>CoinSwap Liquidity Pools</h1>

<h3>CoinSwap Liquidity Pools</h3>
When you provide liquidity to the CoinSwap Liquidity pool, you will receive corresponding pool CSWP-LQ tokens. 
At any time, you can use these CSWP-LQ token to redeem the liquidity that you have provided to the pool (the amount 
of liquidity that you can redeem depends on total liquidity of the current pool).
For each swap transaction, 0.3% transaction fees are deducted from the transaction. These fees are 
put back to the liquiditiy pool so that they can be distributed to the pool liquidity providers proportionally.
For certain pools, you can stake your CSWP-LQ tokens to earn CSWP governance tokens CSWP. For details, check

For each pool, please check <a href="http://bsccoinswap.io/#/configureICO">here </a> for the parameters of each pool
by providing the pool token addresses or the pair address. There are two kinds of CoinSwap Pairs:
<ol>
	<li>regular pair</li>
    <li>ICO pair</li>		
</ol>
Therev are distinguished by the ICO flags in the pair parameter. For ICO pairs, the ICO patron may revise 
the token prices at any time. So if you are not the ICO patron, you should NOT provide liquidity to the ICO pairs.
